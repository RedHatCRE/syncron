// Package cli contains miscellaneous definitions that are related with
// Syncron's command line client.
//
// The purpose of this package is to bridge the gap between Cobra
// (the CLI framework) and Syncron so that they both get to use the same
// values and, thus, understanding between the two components gets easier.
